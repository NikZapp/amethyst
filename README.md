# Amethyst
A small, event based plugin system written in python.  

# Setup
The only thing you may need to set up is the plugin directory. It is configured in the declaration of the `amethyst` dictionary.  

# Launching
After you have completed the setup, you can launch Amethyst by going in its directory and, while using the terminal, type `python3 main.py`.  

# TODO
> Add plugin development documentation
