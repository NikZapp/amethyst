# Amethyst
A small, event based plugin system written in python.  

# Setup
The only thing you may need to set up is the plugin directory.  
To change it, go to line 33.  

# Launching
After you have completed the setup, you can launch Amethyst by going in its directory and, while using the terminal, type `python3 main.py`.  

# TODO
> Add a separate configuration file  
> Add a CLI for setting up the configuration file  
> Add plugin development documentation
